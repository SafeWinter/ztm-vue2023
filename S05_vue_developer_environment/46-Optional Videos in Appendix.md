# S05P46: Optional Videos In Appendix

In the coming videos, we are going to assume you have a general understanding of these topics:

- Basic command-line functions (i.e., `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`)
- Run JavaScript files with NodeJS in the command line (i.e., **`node app.js`**)
- Understand how CommonJS modules work in NodeJS as well as ES6 Modules

If you would like a refresher on these topics or you feel like you don't have enough knowledge of the above, we have provided some videos for you in the ***Appendix: Extra Bits*** section at the end of this course which you can watch now before jumping into the next lectures. Enjoy!

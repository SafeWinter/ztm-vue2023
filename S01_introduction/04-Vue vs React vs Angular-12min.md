# S01P04: Vue vs React vs Angular



When asked in job interview: **Which is the best, Vue, React or Angular?**

You should ask back: **What does the team look like?**



Comparison:

- **Angular**: a kitchen (big company, large number of teams, devs etc)
- **React**: an oven (fast prototype, startups)
- **Vue**: a fridge & an oven (feasible, combine the merits of the two)
